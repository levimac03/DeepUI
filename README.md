## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Prerequisite

**This tool requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to be installed and running on your system.**

DeepUI is a frontend interface that connects to Ollama, which handles the actual AI model loading and execution. Without Ollama installed and properly configured, DeepUI will not function.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stylish Console Interface**: Matrix-inspired terminal UI with a modern twist
- **One-Click AI Access**: Launch any supported model instantly via Ollama
- **Automatic Model Installation**: DeepUI will download models on demand - no manual setup required
- **Curated Model Selection**: Easy access to popular models available through Ollama
- **Zero Additional Configuration**: Works out of the box with your existing Ollama setup
- **Lightweight**: Minimal system requirements, runs on any modern Windows PC
